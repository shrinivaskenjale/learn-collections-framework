/*
 * ====================================
 * Algorithms in collection framework
 * ====================================
 * 
 * The Java collections framework provides various algorithms that can be used
 * to manipulate elements stored in data structures.
 * 
 * Algorithms in Java are static methods that can be used to perform various
 * operations on collections. These methods are present in java.util.Collections
 * class.
 * Note - java.util.Collection is interface and java.util.Collections is class.
 * 
 * Collections class has private constructor to make sure it can't be
 * instantiated.
 * 
 * Since algorithms can be used on various collections, these are also known as
 * generic algorithms.

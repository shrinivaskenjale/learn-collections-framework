Natural order refers to the default sorting order that is defined by the data type itself â€” it is the order used when no custom Comparator is provided.

ðŸ“Œ For example:
For numbers: natural order means ascending order (1, 2, 3, â€¦).

For strings: natural order means lexicographical (dictionary) order ("apple", "banana", "cat", â€¦).

For custom classes: natural order is defined by implementing the Comparable interface and overriding the compareTo() method.



Comparable<T>: Defines natural ordering. Implemented by the class itself.

Comparator<T>: Defines custom ordering. Often used with lambdas or anonymous classes.
